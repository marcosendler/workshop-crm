# Project Phases — Workshop CRM

> **Status Legend:** [ ] Pending | [x] Completed
>
> Each task includes the automated **Pest feature tests** to be generated as acceptance criteria.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

Everything needed before building any features: design system, database, models, and multi-tenancy.

---

### Phase 1.1: Tailwind Theme & Color Palette

Configure the Tailwind CSS theme with the project's design tokens (see `docs/design/padrao_de_cores.png`).

- [ ] Define custom color palette in `resources/css/app.css` using `@theme`:
  - Primary: `#5E81F4`
  - Primary dark: `#1C1D21`
  - Primary grey: `#8181A5`
  - Primary outline: `#5E81F4`
  - Outline: `#F0F0F3`
  - Background light: `#F5F5FA`
  - Background: `#F6F6F6`
  - Background white: `#FFFFFF`
  - Button hover: `#1C1D21` at 10% opacity
  - Secondary yellow: `#F4BE5E`
  - Secondary green: `#7CE7AC`
  - Secondary red: `#FF808B`
  - Secondary purple: `#9698D6`
- [ ] Import the design system font (Inter or Instrument Sans as base) via `@theme`
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify compilation

**Tests:**
- None (visual/CSS — verified by build success).

---

### Phase 1.2: Blade UI Components

Create reusable anonymous Blade components matching `docs/design/botoes.png`, `docs/design/formularios.png`, and `docs/design/checkbox.png`.

- [ ] **Button component** (`resources/views/components/button.blade.php`)
  - Variants: `primary`, `outline`, `danger`, `success`
  - States: active, hover, resting, disabled
  - Support for icon slot (left icon)
  - Size prop: `sm`, `md`, `lg`
- [ ] **Input component** (`resources/views/components/input.blade.php`)
  - Text fields with floating/top label style
  - States: default, focus (primary underline), error (red underline + icon), success (green underline + checkmark)
  - Support for left icon slot
  - Integration with `@error` directive
- [ ] **Textarea component** (`resources/views/components/textarea.blade.php`)
- [ ] **Select component** (`resources/views/components/select.blade.php`)
  - Dropdown with item list styling per design
  - Support for icon items variant
- [ ] **Checkbox component** (`resources/views/components/checkbox.blade.php`)
  - States: unchecked, checked, disabled unchecked, disabled checked, error, success
- [ ] **Radio component** (`resources/views/components/radio.blade.php`)
  - States: unchecked, checked, disabled unchecked, disabled checked, error, success
- [ ] **Toggle component** (`resources/views/components/toggle.blade.php`)
  - States: on, off, disabled on, disabled off, error, success
- [ ] **Modal component** (`resources/views/components/modal.blade.php`)
  - Overlay backdrop, centered content, close button
  - Livewire-compatible (open/close via `wire:click`)
  - Title slot + body slot + footer slot
- [ ] **Tag component** (`resources/views/components/tag.blade.php`)
  - Color variants matching design: primary, yellow, green, red, purple, outline
  - Optional close/remove button

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Components/ButtonComponentTest.php` — renders each variant, renders disabled state, renders with icon slot.
- `tests/Feature/Components/InputComponentTest.php` — renders with label, displays error message from validation, renders with icon.
- `tests/Feature/Components/SelectComponentTest.php` — renders options, renders with placeholder.
- `tests/Feature/Components/ModalComponentTest.php` — renders with title and body slots, renders close button.

---

### Phase 1.3: Layouts

Create the two base layouts derived from `docs/design/layout_base_login.png` (guest) and `docs/design/dashboard.png` (authenticated).

- [ ] **Guest layout** (`resources/views/layouts/guest.blade.php`)
  - Two-column split: left form area (white) + right illustration area (blue/primary)
  - Used for: login, registration, password reset, invitation registration
  - Includes `@vite` and `@livewireStyles` / `@livewireScripts`
- [ ] **App layout** (`resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`)
  - Left sidebar with:
    - Company logo/avatar at top
    - Welcome message with user name
    - Icon-based navigation links (Dashboard, Kanban, Team, Settings)
    - Bottom section for secondary nav
  - Main content area with top bar (page title, search, notifications)
  - Flash message display area using `@session` directive
  - Responsive: sidebar collapses to hamburger menu on mobile
  - Includes `@vite` and `@livewireStyles` / `@livewireScripts`

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Layouts/GuestLayoutTest.php` — guest layout renders without auth, contains Vite assets.
- `tests/Feature/Layouts/AppLayoutTest.php` — app layout requires authentication (redirects to login if guest), renders sidebar navigation, displays authenticated user name.

---

### Phase 1.4: Database Migrations — Lookup Tables

Create migrations for all lookup/auxiliary tables and their seeders. These are global (not tenant-scoped).

- [ ] Migration: `create_roles_table` — id, name (varchar 50, unique), timestamps
- [ ] Migration: `create_user_statuses_table` — id, name (varchar 50, unique), timestamps
- [ ] Migration: `create_pipeline_stages_table` — id, name (varchar 100, unique), sort_order (integer, unique), is_terminal (boolean, default false), timestamps
- [ ] Migration: `create_invitation_statuses_table` — id, name (varchar 50, unique), timestamps
- [ ] Migration: `create_whatsapp_connection_statuses_table` — id, name (varchar 50, unique), timestamps
- [ ] Seeder: `RoleSeeder` — Business Owner, Salesperson
- [ ] Seeder: `UserStatusSeeder` — Active, Inactive
- [ ] Seeder: `PipelineStageSeeder` — New Lead (1), Contacted (2), Qualified (3), Proposal Sent (4), Negotiation (5), Won (6, terminal), Lost (7, terminal)
- [ ] Seeder: `InvitationStatusSeeder` — Pending, Accepted, Revoked, Expired
- [ ] Seeder: `WhatsappConnectionStatusSeeder` — Connected, Disconnected
- [ ] Update `DatabaseSeeder` to call all lookup seeders
- [ ] Run migrations and seeders successfully

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Database/LookupTableSeederTest.php` — after seeding: roles table has 2 records, user_statuses has 2, pipeline_stages has 7 in correct sort order with correct is_terminal flags, invitation_statuses has 4, whatsapp_connection_statuses has 2. Seeders are idempotent (running twice does not duplicate).

---

### Phase 1.5: Database Migrations — Core Tables

Create migrations for the tenant and all tenant-scoped domain tables.

- [ ] Migration: `create_tenants_table` — id, name (varchar 255), timestamps
- [ ] Migration: `modify_users_table` — add tenant_id (FK → tenants, cascade), role_id (FK → roles, restrict), user_status_id (FK → user_statuses, restrict); add index on tenant_id
- [ ] Migration: `create_leads_table` — id, tenant_id (FK → tenants, cascade), user_id (FK → users, restrict), name (varchar 255), email (varchar 255), phone (varchar 50, nullable), timestamps; unique index on (tenant_id, email); index on user_id
- [ ] Migration: `create_deals_table` — id, tenant_id (FK → tenants, cascade), lead_id (FK → leads, cascade), user_id (FK → users, restrict), pipeline_stage_id (FK → pipeline_stages, restrict), title (varchar 255), value (decimal 12,2, default 0), loss_reason (text, nullable), sort_order (integer, default 0), timestamps; indexes on tenant_id, lead_id, user_id, pipeline_stage_id; composite index on (tenant_id, pipeline_stage_id, sort_order)
- [ ] Migration: `create_deal_notes_table` — id, tenant_id (FK → tenants, cascade), deal_id (FK → deals, cascade), user_id (FK → users, restrict), body (text), timestamps; indexes on deal_id, tenant_id
- [ ] Migration: `create_invitations_table` — id, tenant_id (FK → tenants, cascade), invited_by_user_id (FK → users, restrict), invitation_status_id (FK → invitation_statuses, restrict), email (varchar 255), token (varchar 255, unique), expires_at (timestamp), timestamps; indexes on tenant_id, (tenant_id, email)
- [ ] Migration: `create_whatsapp_connections_table` — id, tenant_id (FK → tenants, unique + cascade), whatsapp_connection_status_id (FK → whatsapp_connection_statuses, restrict), instance_name (varchar 255, nullable), instance_id (varchar 255, nullable), phone_number (varchar 50, nullable), timestamps
- [ ] Run all migrations successfully

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Database/CoreTableMigrationTest.php` — all tables exist with correct columns, foreign keys enforce referential integrity (e.g., creating a lead without a valid tenant_id fails), unique constraints enforced (duplicate tenant_id+email on leads fails), cascade deletes work (deleting tenant removes its users/leads/deals).

---

### Phase 1.6: Eloquent Models, Relationships & Factories

Create all domain models with their relationships, casts, fillable attributes, and test factories.

- [ ] **Tenant model** — fillable: name; relationships: `users()` hasMany, `leads()` hasMany, `deals()` hasMany, `invitations()` hasMany, `whatsappConnection()` hasOne
- [ ] **Role model** — fillable: name; relationships: `users()` hasMany
- [ ] **UserStatus model** — fillable: name; relationships: `users()` hasMany
- [ ] **PipelineStage model** — fillable: name, sort_order, is_terminal; casts: is_terminal → boolean; relationships: `deals()` hasMany
- [ ] **InvitationStatus model** — fillable: name; relationships: `invitations()` hasMany
- [ ] **WhatsappConnectionStatus model** — fillable: name; relationships: `whatsappConnections()` hasMany
- [ ] **User model** (update existing) — add to fillable: tenant_id, role_id, user_status_id; relationships: `tenant()` belongsTo, `role()` belongsTo, `userStatus()` belongsTo, `leads()` hasMany, `deals()` hasMany, `dealNotes()` hasMany, `invitationsSent()` hasMany
- [ ] **Lead model** — fillable: tenant_id, user_id, name, email, phone; relationships: `tenant()` belongsTo, `owner()` belongsTo(User), `deals()` hasMany
- [ ] **Deal model** — fillable: tenant_id, lead_id, user_id, pipeline_stage_id, title, value, loss_reason, sort_order; casts: value → decimal:2; relationships: `tenant()` belongsTo, `lead()` belongsTo, `owner()` belongsTo(User), `pipelineStage()` belongsTo, `notes()` hasMany(DealNote)
- [ ] **DealNote model** — fillable: tenant_id, deal_id, user_id, body; relationships: `tenant()` belongsTo, `deal()` belongsTo, `author()` belongsTo(User)
- [ ] **Invitation model** — fillable: tenant_id, invited_by_user_id, invitation_status_id, email, token, expires_at; casts: expires_at → datetime; relationships: `tenant()` belongsTo, `invitedBy()` belongsTo(User), `invitationStatus()` belongsTo
- [ ] **WhatsappConnection model** — fillable: tenant_id, whatsapp_connection_status_id, instance_name, instance_id, phone_number; relationships: `tenant()` belongsTo, `whatsappConnectionStatus()` belongsTo
- [ ] **Factories** for all models: TenantFactory, UserFactory (update), RoleFactory, UserStatusFactory, PipelineStageFactory, InvitationStatusFactory, WhatsappConnectionStatusFactory, LeadFactory, DealFactory, DealNoteFactory, InvitationFactory, WhatsappConnectionFactory

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Models/TenantModelTest.php` — can create tenant, has users/leads/deals/invitations/whatsappConnection relationships.
- `tests/Feature/Models/UserModelTest.php` — belongs to tenant/role/userStatus, has leads/deals relationships, factory works with all states.
- `tests/Feature/Models/LeadModelTest.php` — belongs to tenant/owner, has deals relationship, unique email per tenant enforced.
- `tests/Feature/Models/DealModelTest.php` — belongs to tenant/lead/owner/pipelineStage, has notes relationship, value cast to decimal.
- `tests/Feature/Models/DealNoteModelTest.php` — belongs to deal/author/tenant.
- `tests/Feature/Models/InvitationModelTest.php` — belongs to tenant/invitedBy/invitationStatus, expires_at cast to datetime.
- `tests/Feature/Models/WhatsappConnectionModelTest.php` — belongs to tenant/status, one per tenant enforced.

---

### Phase 1.7: Multi-Tenancy Trait & Scoping

Implement the `BelongsToTenant` trait that auto-scopes all queries and auto-fills `tenant_id` on creation.

- [ ] Create `app/Traits/BelongsToTenant.php`:
  - Add a global scope that filters by `auth()->user()->tenant_id`
  - Boot method: auto-fill `tenant_id` on creating event from authenticated user
  - Prevent cross-tenant access at query level
- [ ] Apply trait to: Lead, Deal, DealNote, Invitation, WhatsappConnection
- [ ] Verify User model has tenant scoping via relationship (not the trait, since User itself needs to be queried across tenants for login)

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Tenancy/TenantScopingTest.php` — authenticated user can only query records from their own tenant; creating a model auto-fills tenant_id; user from Tenant A cannot see Tenant B's leads/deals/invitations; unauthenticated requests do not leak data.
- `tests/Feature/Tenancy/TenantAutoFillTest.php` — creating a Lead while authenticated automatically sets tenant_id to current user's tenant.

---

## Phase 2: Authentication

Login, registration, password reset, and logout. Uses the guest layout.

> **Ref:** US-1.1, US-1.2, US-1.3, US-1.4

- [ ] On success: authenticate user and redirect to Kanban dashboard
- [ ] Uses guest layout with split design (form left, illustration right)
- [ ] Validation: company name required, user name required, email required + unique, password required + min:8 + confirmed

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Auth/RegistrationTest.php`:
  - can view registration page (GET /register returns 200)
  - can register with valid data (creates Tenant + User with Business Owner role + Active status)
  - user is authenticated after registration
  - user is redirected to kanban after registration
  - registration fails with duplicate email

- [ ] Uses Laravel's built-in password reset (Password broker)
- [ ] Reset link valid for 60 minutes
- [ ] On success: redirect to login page with success flash message (pt-BR)
- [ ] Uses guest layout

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Auth/PasswordResetTest.php`:
  - can view forgot password page
  - can request password reset link (email sent)
  - can reset password with valid token
  - reset fails with invalid token
  - reset fails with expired token
  - user is redirected to login after successful reset

---

### Phase 2.4: Logout

> **Ref:** US-1.4

  - unauthenticated user is redirected to login when accessing protected routes
  - authenticated user cannot access guest-only routes (login, register)
  - inactive user is logged out and redirected to login

---

## Phase 3: Authorization & Role-Based Access Control

Server-side permission enforcement for Business Owner vs Salesperson.

> **Ref:** US-9.2

---

### Phase 3.1: Authorization Policies

- [ ] **LeadPolicy** — viewAny: Owner sees all, Salesperson sees own; view/update: Owner always, Salesperson only if assigned; create: any authenticated user; assign: Owner only
- [ ] **DealPolicy** — viewAny: Owner sees all, Salesperson sees own; view/update/move: Owner always, Salesperson only if assigned; create: any authenticated user; assign: Owner only
- [ ] **DealNotePolicy** — create: Owner on any deal, Salesperson only on own deals; view: same as deal visibility

> **Ref:** US-2.1, US-2.2, US-2.3

---

### Phase 4.1: Invite Salesperson

> **Ref:** US-2.1, US-8.1

- [ ] Livewire page component: `pages::team.index` — lists team members and pending invitations
- [ ] Invitation form (modal or inline): email field
- [ ] Service: `App\Services\InvitationService` — creates Invitation with secure token, sets status to Pending, sets expires_at (e.g., 72 hours), dispatches invitation email notification
- [ ] Notification: `App\Notifications\InvitationSentNotification` — email in pt-BR with company name and registration link
- [ ] Business Owner can revoke pending invitations (sets status to Revoked)
- [ ] Authorization: only Business Owner can invite

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Team/InviteTest.php`:
  - Business Owner can view invite form
  - Business Owner can send invitation (creates Invitation record with Pending status, unique token, expires_at)
  - invitation email notification is sent
  - Salesperson cannot send invitations (403)
  - cannot invite already registered email
  - Business Owner can revoke pending invitation
  - revoked invitation link no longer works

---

### Phase 4.2: Invitation Registration

> **Ref:** US-2.1 (invited user flow)

- [ ] Livewire page component: `pages::auth.register-invited` — accepts token via route parameter
- [ ] Route: `Route::livewire('/register/invite/{token}', 'pages::auth.register-invited')->name('register.invited')`
- [ ] Form fields: name, password, password confirmation (email pre-filled from invitation, readonly)
- [ ] Service: `App\Services\InvitationService::acceptInvitation()` — validates token, checks not expired/revoked, creates User with Salesperson role + Active status on the invitation's tenant, updates invitation status to Accepted
- [ ] On success: authenticate and redirect to Kanban

**Tests:**

- [ ] Displays: name, email, role name, status (Active/Inactive)
- [ ] Only users from the same tenant are shown (tenant scoping)
- [ ] Authorization: only Business Owner can access

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Team/ViewTeamTest.php`:
  - Business Owner can view team list
  - team list shows all users from same tenant
  - team list does not show users from other tenants
  - Salesperson cannot access team page (403)

---

### Phase 4.4: Deactivate Team Member

> **Ref:** US-2.3

- [ ] Deactivation action on team list (per user row)
- [ ] Confirmation modal before deactivation

---

## Phase 5: Kanban Pipeline

The operational core of the CRM — Kanban board with drag-and-drop using Livewire 4's `wire:sort`.

> **Ref:** US-3.1, US-3.2, US-3.3, US-3.4, US-3.5

---

### Phase 5.1: Kanban Board — View

> **Ref:** US-3.1, US-3.2

- [ ] Livewire page component: `pages::kanban.index`
- [ ] Route: `Route::livewire('/kanban', 'pages::kanban.index')->name('kanban.index')`
- [ ] Displays columns for each pipeline stage (loaded from `pipeline_stages` table, ordered by `sort_order`)
- [ ] Each column renders Deal cards showing: title, monetary value (formatted BRL), Lead name, owner (Salesperson name)
- [ ] **Business Owner** sees all Deals within the tenant
- [ ] **Salesperson** sees only Deals assigned to them
- [ ] Eager loading: deals with lead, owner, pipelineStage to prevent N+1
- [ ] Responsive: columns horizontally scrollable on mobile
- [ ] "New Lead" button visible on the board (opens modal — Phase 5.3)
- [ ] Uses app layout

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Kanban/ViewBoardTest.php`:
  - Business Owner can view kanban board with all tenant deals
  - Salesperson can only see their assigned deals
  - Salesperson cannot see deals from other users
  - deals are grouped by pipeline stage columns
  - deal card displays title, value, lead name, owner name
  - pipeline stages are rendered in correct sort order
  - empty board renders all columns with no cards
  - kanban page requires authentication

---

### Phase 5.2: Kanban Drag & Drop (wire:sort)

> **Ref:** US-3.3

- [ ] Implement `wire:sort` with `wire:sort:group="deals"` on each stage column
- [ ] Each column uses `wire:sort:group-id="{{ $stage->id }}"` to identify the target stage
- [ ] Each Deal card uses `wire:sort:item="{{ $deal->id }}"`
- [ ] Handler method: `handleSort($dealId, $position, $stageId)` — updates deal's `pipeline_stage_id` and `sort_order`
- [ ] Service: `App\Services\DealService::moveToStage()` — updates stage + recalculates sort order for affected columns
- [ ] If moved to "Lost" stage: trigger a modal prompting for required loss reason before completing the move
- [ ] Salesperson can only move their own deals (authorization check in handler)
- [ ] `wire:sort:handle` on a drag handle element within the card

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Kanban/DragDropTest.php`:
  - calling handleSort updates deal pipeline_stage_id and sort_order
  - moving deal to Lost stage requires loss_reason (validation error without it)
  - Salesperson can move their own deals
  - Salesperson cannot move another user's deals
  - Business Owner can move any deal
  - sort order is recalculated correctly within a column
  - moving between columns updates the group-id (stage) correctly

---

### Phase 5.3: Create Lead from Kanban

> **Ref:** US-3.4

- [ ] Modal component triggered by "New Lead" button on Kanban board
- [ ] Livewire Form Object: `App\Livewire\Forms\CreateLeadForm`
- [ ] Step 1: Search by email field — checks if Lead already exists in tenant
- [ ] Step 2a (existing Lead found): display Lead info, show Deal creation form (title, value)
- [ ] Step 2b (new Lead): expand form to collect name, email, phone + Deal title and value
- [ ] Service: `App\Services\LeadService::createWithDeal()` — creates Lead (if new) and Deal in transaction
- [ ] New Deal defaults: pipeline_stage = "New Lead", owner = current user, sort_order = 0 (top of column)
- [ ] Lead uniqueness: tenant_id + email enforced
- [ ] After creation: Deal card appears on Kanban in "New Lead" column (UI refreshes)

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Kanban/CreateLeadTest.php`:
  - can search for existing lead by email
  - creating a new lead creates both Lead and Deal records
  - new deal appears in "New Lead" pipeline stage
  - new deal is assigned to the current user
  - lead email is unique per tenant (duplicate fails with validation error)
  - same email in different tenants is allowed
  - lead fields validated (name required, email required + valid format)
  - deal fields validated (title required, value positive number)

---

### Phase 5.4: Create Deal for Existing Lead

> **Ref:** US-3.5

- [ ] When email search finds an existing Lead in the modal (Phase 5.3), user can create a new Deal
- [ ] Deal form: title, monetary value
- [ ] New Deal linked to the existing Lead
- [ ] Lead can have multiple active Deals

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Kanban/CreateDealExistingLeadTest.php`:
  - can create a new deal for an existing lead
  - existing lead can have multiple deals
  - new deal is in "New Lead" stage
  - new deal is assigned to current user
  - lead data is not duplicated

---

## Phase 6: Deal Management

Detail view, editing, status changes, and notes.

> **Ref:** US-4.1, US-4.2, US-4.3, US-4.4, US-4.5

---

### Phase 6.1: View Deal Details

> **Ref:** US-4.1

- [ ] Clicking a Deal card on the Kanban opens a slide-over or modal with full details
- [ ] Livewire component: `App\Livewire\DealDetail` (nested component, not a page)
- [ ] Displays: Deal title, monetary value (BRL), current stage, Lead info (name, email, phone), Deal owner name
- [ ] Tabs: Details, Notes, WhatsApp (WhatsApp tab only visible if WhatsApp is connected for the tenant)
- [ ] Salesperson can only view their own deals (authorization)
- [ ] Business Owner can view any deal

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Deal/ViewDetailTest.php`:
  - Business Owner can view any deal's detail
  - Salesperson can view their own deal's detail
  - Salesperson cannot view another user's deal (403)
  - deal detail displays all required fields (title, value, stage, lead info, owner)
  - WhatsApp tab only visible when tenant has active WhatsApp connection

---

### Phase 6.2: Edit Deal

> **Ref:** US-4.2

- [ ] Editable fields in the deal detail view: title, monetary value
- [ ] Livewire Form Object: `App\Livewire\Forms\EditDealForm`
- [ ] Validation: title required, value must be a positive number
- [ ] Changes reflected on Kanban card after save
- [ ] Authorization: Salesperson can only edit their own deals

**Tests:**
- `tests/Feature/Deal/EditDealTest.php`:
  - can update deal title and value
